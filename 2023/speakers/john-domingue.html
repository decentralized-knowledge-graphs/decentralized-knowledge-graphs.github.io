          <h2>Towards Trust and Accountability in Knowledge Graph based AI for Self-Determination</h2>
          <p class="text-left" style="color:rgb(19, 24, 22); text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
            In just one minute in April 2022, there were 5,900,000 searches on Google, 1,700,000 pieces of content shared on Facebook, 1,000,000 hours streamed, and 347,200 tweets shared on Twitter. This content and data is linked to a plethora of AI services, providing immense value for users and companies, which have increasingly been based on Knowledge Graphs (KGs), i.e., machine-readable data and schema representations based on a web stack of standards. Over a number of years, however, there has been a growing worry on how personal data can be abused and thus, how AI services impinge on citizen rights. For example, the over centralisation of data and linked abuses led Sir Tim Berners-Lee to call the Web ‘anti-human’ in an interview in 2018 and since 2016, hundreds of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement employees have faced investigations into abuse of confidential law enforcement databases including stalking and harassment to passing data to criminals. In this talk I will outline how technologies such as distributed ledgers, personal data pods such as Solid and personal policy languages (e.g. ODRL) can support trust, accountability, and self-determination in Knowledge Graph-based AI systems.</p>

                <a href="http://people.kmi.open.ac.uk/domingue/">John Domingue</a> is a full Professor of Computer Science at the <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/">Knowledge Media Institute</a>, the Open University’s technology Research and Innovation centre, and the President of <a href="https://www.sti2.org/">STI International</a>, a semantics focused networking organization. He has published over 280 refereed articles in the areas of semantics, the Web, distributed ledgers and eLearning.
Prof. Domingue served as the leader of the first of five themes, on University Learners, for the £40M Institute of Coding which aimed to increase the number and diversity of computing graduates in the UK as well as enhancing the connection between university teaching and corporate training. In 2017 Prof Domingue’s research in blockchains and education was referenced in the <a href="https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC108255/jrc108255_blockchain_in_education%281%29.pdf#page=66">Joint Research Centre Policy Report Blockchain in Education</a> for the European Commission. Prof. Domingue has given many talks on his work including at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wwYDMdji3k">Royal Institution</a> in 2018, at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPefcmWFWyM&t=6s">TEDx</a> and most recently featured in <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/campus/how-successfully-develop-and-run-interdisciplinary-research-teams">THE Campus</a> on interdisciplinary research teams. 
The start of 2022 saw a new project to develop smart national educational content platform (<a href="https://vocteach.ac.uk/">VocTeach Platform</a>), embedding the latest AI techniques, to support FE educators was initiated with John Domingue serving as the overall project lead. 
Since the start of 2023 he has been playing a leading role in exploring how <a href="https://genai.kmi.open.ac.uk/">Generative AI will impact Higher Education</a>. 
In 2019, he became a <a href="https://www.britishblockchainassociation.org/fellowship">Fellow of the British Blockchain Association</a>. In 2020, he became an honorary Professor at Amity University.
