          <h2>Challenges in Real-Time Analysis of Ownership and Control in Banking</h2>
          <p class="text-left" style="color:rgb(19, 24, 22);text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">
            Regulators attempting to monitor changes and issues in the financial sector need ready access to current data. Quarterly reports, such as SEC filings, bank call reports, trade data reporting, other regulatory reports and data requested during examinations provide disconnected insights that support oversight, but may not be sufficiently timely or complete. These reports include terminology that is derived from arcane regulations going back to the early 1900s in some cases.The ability to analyze and predict change, including potential changes in cash flows when catastrophic events occur (or might occur) requires access to distributed content, both public and proprietary, with very clear semantics in order to provide proper oversight. The Financial Industry Business Ontology (FIBO) has been focused on support for financial instrument / securities data management and analysis for more than a decade, with increasing sophistication and coverage in the last several years in particular. Recent work includes supporting regulators in the United States and other countries in analysis related to risk analysis, with ownership and control relations at the heart of that work. The Global LEI Foundation provides an incomplete but important contribution through their ontology of ownership and control data, which we have mapped to FIBO. Other pieces of the puzzle in the US are managed by a repository called the National Information Center (NIC), which is managed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, which has a 1980s data dictionary using terminology that the current data managers may or may not fully understand. None of these sources provide a complete view of the relationships between some of the entities involved in the financial ‘food chain’, but we believe that together the picture is clearer. The speakers are currently actively involved in a project aligning the GLEIF data with data from the NIC repository using and extending semantics from FIBO. Challenges include data currency, which is only possible if the data are loaded remotely from the various sources whenever that data is updated, leveraging additional public sources such as SEC filings, bank filings and others, having real time access to data for cash flow analysis, using for example, additions to FIBO to support the ACTUS cash flow emerging standard, and others. Most of the data is not available in RDF today, though the GLEIF data is published regularly on data.world. In this talk we will explore some of our findings to date and then open up the discussion to workshop participants to brainstorm about potential directions.

                Ms. Kendall has over 30 years professional experience in the design, development and deployment of enterprise-scale information management systems for communications, high technology, and aerospace applications. Her background includes many years in applied research in knowledge representation and ontology design, information architecture, complex event processing, and knowledge based systems development. She has been instrumental in bridging software engineering disciplines, such as theObject Management Group (OMG)’s Model Driven Architecture methodology, which provides a basis for automating metadata management, and knowledge representation and reasoning (Semantic Web) technologies. Ms. Kendall is principal architect of a UML-based ontology analysis, development and application deployment framework, and has developed rigorous methodologies for domain assessment supporting ontology development. Her formal training in Situation Semantics coupled with extensive systems integration experience led to Ms. Kendall’s innovative approach. Ms. Kendall brings deep experience in large-scale, complex taxonomy, ontology and knowledge-based systems development, working for customers such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency of the DoD, NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, SRI International. She represents ontology concerns on the Object Management Group (OMG)’s Architecture Board, and is co-editor of the Ontology Definition Metamodel (ODM). She is also an active participant in the ISO JTC1 SC32 WG2 Metadata working group and was a member of the W3C OWL and Best Practices working groups. Recent projects include commercial ontology development for travel, agricultural, chemical engineering, financial services, and telecommunications applications.

              Pete Rivett has recently joined Golden as their Ontologist. He has been heavily involved in many ontology and knowledge graph efforts, both enterprise-specific and industry-wide including the Financial Industry Business Ontology (FIBO) and the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF) LEI ontology. He is founding director of Enterprise Knowledge Grapoh Foundation (EKGF) and for many years sat on the Architecture Board of Object Management Group (OMG), active in most OMG modeling and ontology standards.
